        <p>Peihan Miao is a former ACM class student who graduated last year and is working for a Ph.D in UC Berkeley. She came back to SJTU and gave us a talk on Tuesday about her experience in UC Berkeley and her suggestions to us, which was inspiring and motivating. Here are some of the points she made which I believe are useful and important.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To take notes</p>
<p>There are situations where you cannot get concentrated or fail to understand the lecturer when you attend a lecture, and where you find it hard to figure out the idea in a paper. Take notes about whatever you have understood or whatever comes to your mind and that will help.<br>Whatever you do, just do not stop writing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To ask questions</p>
<p>When you have a question during a lecture, do not be shy to ask however stupid the question might be, because  it is very likely that the others have the same question.<br>Set goals for yourself, such as “I will ask a question every day”. And when you start to do it, you will concentrate yourself and try hard to catch up with the lecture so that there is a chance for you to figure out some questions to ask.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get out of your comfort zone</p>
<p>Do something more difficult. Try to reach somewhere you need to jump rather than simply raise your hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some days are better than others. Some days are worse.</p>
</li>
<li><p>About deadlines</p>
<p>There are times when you find yourself pushed by assignments, course projects and presentations and have no time left for doing research. Since doing research is what you really want to do, you should not postpone it indefinitely just because there is no specific deadline for it.<br>Set some day in a week as your RESEARCH-DAY, and do research on that day even if it is the end of the world. And as for the other tasks, just put them the day before their deadlines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can be whatever you what to be</p>
<p>When you cannot figure out what exactly you want to be and which kind of life you wish to lead, you need to try each and every one of them. Trying does not mean taking a glimpse and have just a little taste. Rather, it means trying hard and bury yourself into it for some time. Then, you will know whether it is what you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
